**<u>THE TIMKEN/METALLUS MONDAY NIGHT GOLF LEAGUE</u>**

# RULES & REGULATIONS

# REVISED October 11, 2024

The organization shall be known as “The Timken/Metallus Monday Night
Golf League”.

The reference to “Timken” throughout the entire rules and regulations
will apply to both The Timken Company and Metallus, Inc.

**<u>A. Organization</u>**

The league shall consist of no more than 16 teams with a maximum 5
golfers on each team. Each team must have a team name. Each team will be
assigned a team number by random draw, order of finish in the prior
season, or some other method chosen at the annual captain’s meeting. The
specific format of play (number of flights, number of regular season
weeks of head-to-head play, number of rainout weeks, etc.) will also be
determined at the annual meeting.

There will be one annual captain’s meeting prior to the start of league
play. It shall be the duty of the President to set the date for the
annual meeting and to notify all team captains. Only officers and team
captains may attend the annual meeting. In the event a captain may not
be able to attend the meeting, a representative from that team should
attend. Only team captains or their representatives may vote. A quorum
of 75% of the captains and/or representatives must be present at the
annual meeting in order to conduct business.

Rules can only be changed at the beginning of seasons in odd-numbered
years (e.g. 2023). All proposed rule changes must be submitted to the
Secretary prior to the annual meeting. The Secretary will request
proposed rule changes at the end of each season in even-numbered years
and again prior to the next annual meeting. Proposed rule changes may be
submitted by any captain or league officer. Proposed rule changes will
be sent to all captains, with notation of the captain who submitted the
proposed rule change, for consideration before the annual meeting. An
affirmative vote by more than 50% of the captains will be necessary to
change or add any rules. Each captain should vote the way the majority
of the golfers on their team would vote. All regular and regular sub
team members should have a voice in determining their team’s vote.
Discussion on any proposed rule changes shall be limited to 10 minutes
for each proposed rule change.

**<u>B. Officers</u>**

Officers of the league will consist of a President and a Secretary.

The President will be an elected position. The President will not be
required to pay greens fees or league dues. The Secretary will be a
volunteer position. The Secretary will not be required to pay greens
fees or league dues. A new President will be elected on an annual basis
by a majority vote of the league captains. The President and Secretary
will concur on any subject concerning the welfare of the league.

**<u>C. Election of Officers</u>**

Each year the current league President will conduct an election process
for the next year’s President. This process will work as follows:

From the current team rosters for regular team members, determine those

golfers who have never fulfilled the obligation of being a league
officer.

> From that list, select at least four golfers and determine if they
> have interest in being President of the league. Of those interested,
> the current President will have the responsibility of conducting the
> election process and the current year’s captains must pick one golfer
> to fill the role of President for the following year. The highest vote
> getter will be elected the following year’s President. In the event of
> a tie, the current President will be asked to break the tie.

If there is no interest from the league in terms of a new President, the
election process will not take place. The current President may choose
to continue to serve as President until another candidate decides to
participate in the election. In the event that the current President
does not wish to continue his/her position, the Secretary may decide to
fulfill both roles (President & Secretary). In the event that no one
will choose to be President, the league will be terminated.

If for any reason, an officer cannot fulfill their obligation, the
following rules apply:

1.  If the elected President cannot fulfill the obligation, the position
    will then be filled by a special election.

<!-- -->

2.  If the Secretary cannot fulfill the obligation, the position will
    then be filled by a special election.

Any officer not fulfilling their obligation as listed above will not be
allowed to participate in the league as a regular or regular sub team
member during the remainder of what would have ordinarily been their
term in office. They may be able to participate in the league once their
ordinary term in office has expired.

**<u>D. Eligibility</u>**

League officers and Team Captains, and a minimum of 50% of each team’s
roster (regular league players and regular team member subs) must meet
<u>one</u> of the following criteria:

- Active Timken associate

- Retired Timken associate

- Part-time Timken associate

- Contingent associate working at Timken

- Timken associate that was separated from the company

- Immediate family member (parent, spouse, brother, sister, or child) of
  one of the above categories.

*NOTE: An immediate family member choosing to be a regular league player
or regular team member sub does not need to have a family member in the
league as a regular league player or regular team member sub.*

*NOTE: All retired Timken associates and Timken associates separated
from the company may continue to play in the league as long as they
desire.*

Any sub that is not considered a “regular team member sub” for a team
will be considered a “general sub”. “General subs” will be listed
separately on a sub list. A general sub may be any golfer that is asked
to play for a regular league player or regular team member sub that
cannot play in a given match for whatever reason. The general sub does
not have to be associated with Timken. On any given night, on any given
team, there is no limit to the number of “general subs” that may be
used; however, there may be only one general sub that does not fit the
eligibility criteria for regular league players and regular team member
subs above. Handicaps for general subs will be calculated in the same
manner as they are for regular league members and regular team member
subs.

**<u>E. Greens Fees & League Dues</u>**

Green fees and league dues are to be paid by each regular member of the
league. These will be determined at the annual captain’s meeting. Greens
fees and league dues are payable to the President prior to the start of
the season. The President will submit a list of any delinquent paying
teams and/or golfers to the Secretary prior to the start of league play.
The President and Secretary will take the necessary action to collect
the monies or to find a replacement golfer(s) and/or team(s).

League dues may be used to finance a golf outing, alternative event at
the end of the season, or prizes to winning teams.

**<u>F. Team Format</u>**

Each team will list 4 members as regular team members. These 4 members
are eligible to substitute on another team as long as that team is not
involved in a head-to-head match with the golfer’s regular team.

Each team may list a “regular team member sub” in addition to the 4
regular golfers. They will be considered a regular member of the team
except that he or she is not subject to league dues (unless special
agreements are made by the team’s captain). The regular team member sub
for the team will be considered a regular team member with respect to
“subbing” for a golfer on the team. The regular team member sub may also
play with any other team except the team playing against the team on
which he or she is listed as a regular team member sub.

**<u>G. Season Structure</u>**

The season will consist of a number of nights of golf with nine-hole
matches each night. The specific number of nights will be determined by
the Officers in order to create a schedule that is as fair as possible
for all teams and that works within the arrangements that have been
contracted with the course. The principles to be followed in
constructing the season’s schedule will be:

1.  A maximum or two practice nights with assigned tee times at the
    beginning of the season

2.  Each team plays every other team in the league (or their flight) the
    maximum possible integral number of times (round robins)

3.  Any nights remaining after completion of the scheduled round robins
    and before the Playoffs will be filled in the following priority
    order

    1.  Make-up of any matches that were not played due to weather or
        other circumstances

    2.  The last competitive night prior to the Playoffs will be a
        “Knockdown” round

    3.  One optional “Low Team Net” tournament night (no impact on
        league standings)

    4.  Additional competitive matches with opponents determined by
        random draw, with the last-placed team playing the Blind Draw
        team if one exists

Deviation from the above principles must be approved by the league
Captains.

At the end of the season, a “playoff” night will be held. The league
captains may also discuss and/or vote on having a league outing which
may replace or be in addition to the “playoff” night.

Tee times will be finalized by the President and the golf course. Prior
to the start of league play, a schedule will be published by the
Secretary.

Twice during the regular season, the \#1 golfers will play with the \#3
golfers and the \#2 golfers will play with the \#4 golfers. Twice during
the season the \#1 golfers will play with the \#4 golfers and the \#2
golfers will play with the \#3 golfers. These will be noted on the
schedule.

Official day of play will be Monday evening after work.

The following week’s scheduled matches (after a rainout) will be the
normal matches according to the league schedule.

**<u>H. Cancelling Golf</u>**

The President and Secretary can make the call earlier in the day (and
will notify the Captains as soon as possible) if weather conditions are
extreme and the probability is high that the golf matches would be
cancelled at the course.

On rainy days, the President will check with the golf course by 4:00
p.m. to determine whether the course is going to be open and/or
playable. Unless notified by the officers that league play has been
postponed because the course has been closed, each player is expected to
be present at the course for play or be subject to forfeiture.

A majority vote of team Captains or a team delegate will be needed to
cancel golf due to inclement weather. All Captains and team delegates
must be present at the golf course clubhouse to vote. Voting should take
place at a reasonable time based on the presence of as many Captains and
team delegates as possible and within sufficient time to complete the
round prior to darkness. The President and Secretary will be responsible
for coordinating the voting. In the event there is a tie due to missing
Captains or team delegates, the decision process reverts back to the
President and Secretary. In the event that one of the officers is not
present, the decision will be made by the officer that is present. If
neither officer will be present, each officer must select a Captain (in
advance) and the captains selected must mutually agree whether or not to
play golf.

**<u>I. Handicaps</u>**

Golfers will be handicapped on the basis of 36 par. Individual handicaps
will be 96% of the difference between the golfer’s average gross score
and 36 par. Maximum handicap is 20.

Handicap holes will be based on the men’s handicap as shown on the golf
course scorecard.

In figuring handicaps, rounding of decimals will be to 2 places, and
fractions of 0.50 and over will be counted as the higher whole number,
for purposes of calculating net scores only.

The number of strokes to be given or received in a match will be
calculated by taking the difference between the two players’ handicaps
(rounded to 2 places), with fractions of 0.50 and over being rounded up
to the next higher whole number.

> Example: Golfer A has a calculated handicap of 5.73 and shoots a gross
> score of 43 in a match with Golfer B, who shoots a 45 with a
> calculated handicap of 7.49.
>
> Golfer A gives Golfer B 2 strokes 🡪 7.49 – 5.73 = 1.76 which rounds to
> 2
>
> Golfer A’s net score is 37 🡪 5.73 rounds to 6 🡪 43 – 6 = 37
>
> Golfer B’s net score is 38 🡪 7.49 rounds to 7 🡪 45 – 7 = 38

Handicap calculations that are voted on and revised will remain in place
for two full seasons prior to being voted on and potentially changed.

Handicaps will be calculated based on a player’s last 10 gross scores.
Until 10 rounds in the current season have been played, a player’s gross
scores from the immediately prior season will be used. The following
table shows the number of gross scores to be used in the handicap
calculation.

| Existing Gross Scores | \# Gross Scores Used |
|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|
|    0 (New Player)     |    1<sup>1</sup>     |
|           1           |    1<sup>2</sup>     |
|           2           |    1<sup>3</sup>     |
|           3           |    1<sup>4</sup>     |

Handicap Calculations

<sup>1</sup> When **no gross scores exist** from earlier rounds in the
current and immediately prior season (i.e., new player to the league),
the handicap for the first night will be 96% of the difference between
his/her first night’s gross score and course par (36) ,**minus two
strokes**.

<sup>2</sup> When **one gross score exists** from earlier rounds in the
current and/or immediately prior season, the handicap for the second
night will be 96% of the difference between course par (36) and the
lower of two values: the existing gross score and the second night's
gross score, **minus one stroke**.

<sup>3</sup> When **two gross scores exist** from earlier rounds in the
current and/or immediately prior season, the handicap for the third
night will be 96% of the difference between course par (36) and the
lowest of three values: the two existing gross scores and the third
night's gross score.

<sup>4</sup> When **three gross scores exist** from earlier rounds in
the current and/or immediately prior season, the handicap for the fourth
night will be 96% of the difference between course par (36) and the
lowest of four values: the three existing gross scores and the fourth
night's gross score.

<sup>5</sup> When **four gross scores exist** from earlier rounds in the
current and/or immediately prior season, the handicap for the fifth
night will be 96% of the difference between course par (36) and the
lowest of five values: the four existing gross scores and the fifth
night's gross score.

<sup>6</sup> When **five gross scores exist** from earlier rounds in the
current and/or immediately prior season, the player has an established
handicap for the sixth night of play, calculated as 96% of the
difference between the lowest of the existing five gross scores and
course par (36).

<sup>7</sup> When **six gross scores exist** from earlier rounds in the
current and/or immediately prior season, the player has an established
handicap for the seventh night of play, calculated as 96% of the
difference between the average of the lowest two of the existing six
gross scores and course par (36).

<sup>8</sup> When **seven gross scores exist** from earlier rounds in
the current and/or immediately prior season, the player has an
established handicap for the eighth night of play, calculated as 96% of
the average of the lowest three of the existing seven gross scores and
course par (36).

<sup>9</sup> When **eight gross scores exist** from earlier rounds in
the current and/or immediately prior season, the player has an
established handicap for the ninth night of play, calculated as 96% of
the difference between the average of the lowest four of the existing
eight gross scores and course par (36).

<sup>10</sup> When **nine gross scores exist** from earlier rounds in
the current and/or immediately prior season, the player has an
established handicap for the tenth night of play, calculated as 96% of
the difference between the average of the lowest four of the existing
nine gross scores and course par (36).

<sup>11</sup> When **ten or more gross scores exist** from earlier
rounds in the current and/or immediately prior season, the player has an
established handicap for future nights of play, calculated as 96% of the
difference between the average of the lowest five of the most recent ten
gross scores and course par (36).

**<u>J. Scoring</u>**

Low handicap player on each team will be known as the \#1 golfer, second
lowest handicap as the \#2 golfer, third lowest handicap as the \#3
golfer, and the 4<sup>th</sup> lowest handicap as the \#4 golfer. Both
golfers involved in a match should keep their own score and the score of
their opponent.

The maximum number of strokes per hole is 5 over par (applies to all
tees).  If one person in the match must pick up due to reaching the
maximum number of strokes, and the opponent is able to hole out with the
maximum or less, the player who picked up will automatically lose the
hole (2 points) regardless of the handicap strokes given / received for
the hole.  In the case where both players reach the maximum prior to
holing out, the hole will be split regardless of the handicap strokes
given / received for the hole.

Individual scoring will be as follows: 2 points for each hole won in the
match, 1 point for each hole halved in the match, and 2 points for low
net in the match. Total points available for a golfer is 20 points.

Team scoring will be as follows: 4 points for low net team score. Total
points available in a match between two teams is 84 points.

A golfer forfeits a match by not showing up to play on the scheduled
night of play. When this occurs, the opponent of the no-show golfer will
play against a “blind draw” player.

A “blind draw” player is defined as a 0-handicap golfer that scores a
40, with bogeys on the four hardest handicap holes in the match, pars on
the remaining five holes, except when an entire team plays against
“blind draw” players. This situation arises when the league has an odd
number of teams. In these matches, the “blind draw” player will be a
0-handicap golfer that shoots a 38, with a bogey on the two hardest
handicap holes in the match and pars on the remaining seven holes.

Match outcome is determined by comparing a player’s actual hole and net
scores against their “blind draw” opponent’s hole and net scores to
determine points won in the normal manner. The team of the forfeiting
player gets no individual points for this match.

**Golfers Showing up Late to Play – Established Handicaps in the
Match:** In the event a golfer shows up late to play and the group has
already teed off, the golfer arriving late may join the match on the
next hole of play. The golfer will receive 0 points for all unplayed
holes regardless of the score the opponent got on those hole(s). The
individual low net of 2 points will be based on the holes played.

**Golfers Showing up Late to Play - Late Golfer Does Not Have an
Established Handicap:** In the event a golfer shows up late to play and
the group has already teed off, the golfer arriving late may join the
group and play; however, the golfer must forfeit the match. Points
awarded to the golfer’s opponent will follow the normal “forfeit” rules.

**Inclement Weather - General:** Play will end when the course sounds
the alarm or there is the presence of lighting/thunder. The match is not
considered a forfeit and points will be awarded based on whether the
golfers in the match have an established handicap or not.

**Inclement Weather / Darkness – Established Handicaps in a Match:**
Matches that are ended due to inclement weather or darkness will have
the 2 individual net points awarded based on the total points earned
from the <u>completed</u> holes. In the event points earned are the
same, the individual net points will be split. The points associated
with unplayed holes will be split. Team net (4 points) will be based on
the <u>completed matches</u>, if any. If there are no completed matches,
the team net points will be split.

**Inclement Weather / Darkness – Golfer(s) without Established Handicaps
in a Match:** Matches that are ended due to inclement weather or
darkness (regardless if there is agreement between the golfers in the
match to stop the match) will have the points split 10 / 10 regardless
of

how many holes have been completed. Team net (4 points) will be based on
the <u>completed matches</u>, if any. If there are no completed matches,
the team net points will be split.

**Match Ends for Reasons Other than Inclement Weather:** If any golfer
quits or leaves a match for reasons <u>other than</u> inclement weather
or darkness <u>and</u> both golfers have established handicaps, the
remaining points will be awarded at the discretion of the officers. The
same situation applies if the golfer choosing to quit or leave the golf
course does not have an established handicap. The officers must be given
the details of the situation in order for a decision to be made.

Handicaps are not impacted when a match is not completed. Captains must
communicate to the Secretary matches that are not completed in order to
ensure handicaps are not impacted.

Captains must agree on all scores and points for each match. One captain
(or that captain’s designee) must submit scores and points to the
Secretary via email using a pre-established Excel file. The
pre-established Excel file may be revised from time to time to assist
with the scoring or data analytics. Team scores from Monday’s matches
are to be submitted to the Secretary no later than Thursday at 5:00 p.m.
Failure to submit the scores to the Secretary (by either captain or one
of the captain’s designates) or to inform the Secretary that the scores
will be later than the 5:00 p.m. Thursday deadline, will result in both
teams receiving zero points – no exceptions. Also, handicaps will not be
adjusted.

Weekly standings and revised handicaps will be issued after all results
have been turned into the Secretary and before the following week’s
matches.

The teams with the most points in each flight will be considered
“regular season flight champions”. Each regular season flight champion
team will receive (1) cash award to be distributed by the Captain.
Dollar value of the cash awards will be set at the annual captain’s
meeting.

**<u>K. Miscellaneous Rules</u>**

The course rules and regulations (as they appear on the scorecard) will
be followed during league play, unless noted differently below.

Women will play from the forward tee position.

Men will play from either one of two tees (“normal” or “forward”) based
on their age on the first night of the regular season. Men that are 60
and over prior to the start of the regular season have the option of
playing from a forward set of tees. This option must be selected prior
to the start of the regular season and must be communicated to the
Secretary. Each golfer selecting this option must play from this tee box
the entire season. Handicaps must be re-established based on the
selection of playing from a different tee box than the prior season. Men
that are less than 60 years of age will play from the normal tee box
unless the rule below is exercised based on the prior season’s handicap.
Any golfer who reaches the age of 75 years old may play any tee box they
choose. This option must be selected prior to the start of the regular
season and must be communicated to the Secretary. Each golfer selecting
this option must play from the selected tee box the entire season.

Prior to the first night of regular season play, Captains must submit to
the Secretary any men that have elected to play the forward tees for the
entire upcoming season, regardless of age. Handicaps must be
re-established based on the election of playing from the forward tees.
The election of moving to the forward tees requires an established
handicap of greater than or equal to 15.00 from the prior season. If the
golfer’s (that elected to move to the forward tees) handicap drops to
less than 10.00 and the golfer is less than 60 years of age at the end
of the golf season, the golfer must return to the normal tees the
following season and re-establish a handicap.

**Order of Play – Tee Box:** The first foursome in the match has the
honors on the tee. If the first foursome is not able to tee off due to
an absent golfer(s), the second foursome may request to tee off ahead of
the first foursome. The first foursome must honor the request.

**Winter Rules:** Applicable to the fairway and the rough. The lie of
the ball may be improved in the fairway or the rough only by the use of
the club head. The ball may not be moved more than 6 inches, and no
closer to the hole. This movement is not to allow line-of-sight relief
from natural course obstructions. If more than a 6 inch movement is
required to provide a reasonable lie, mutual agreement between player
and opponent is required.

**Out of Bounds – Tee Box:** Golfer should play a provisional ball from
the tee box. If a provisional ball has been played from the tee box and
the original ball is out of bounds, a one stroke penalty must be added.
If the golfer chooses not to play a provisional ball, the ball must be
dropped within two club lengths from the point the ball crossed the out
of bounds line, no closer to the hole. Penalty: one stroke.

**Out of Bounds – Fairway:** Golfer should play a provisional ball from
a spot that is close as possible to the spot where the previous shot was
made. If a provisional ball has been played from the fairway and the
original ball is out of bounds, a one stroke penalty must be added. If
the golfer chooses not to play a provisional ball, the ball must be
dropped within two club lengths from the point the ball crossed the out
of bounds line, no closer to the hole. Penalty: one stroke.

**Lost Ball:** Drop ball at a location near the spot where the ball is
deemed lost. Golfer and opponent must agree on the location of the lost
ball. Penalty: 1 stroke. Lost balls associated with high grass areas
require the drop to be outside the high grass areas. The drop must be
made within 2 club lengths outside the grass area. Penalty: 1 stroke.
All drops for lost balls must be no nearer to the hole.

For lost balls that enter the water on Raintree’s hole \#8, drop balls
in a drop zone established by course management, or in described/defined
zones proximate to the greens as established by the league officers.
Penalty: 1 stroke.

**Unplayable Lie:** 1 stroke penalty. Move the ball two club lengths no
closer to the hole.

**Free Drop:** A ball may be dropped without penalty when: 1) ball comes
to rest in an area marked by “ground under repair”, 2) casual water, 3)
electrical box, 4) drain, or 5) wrong green / wrong tee box.

**Other:**

A golfer has the option of removing the flagstick, having it attended,
or left in while putting on the green.

Range finders and GPS devices are allowed in league play and in the
playoffs.

The league officers will have the final decision on all matters not
covered by these rules, or any disputes that may occur. USGA rules will
apply when situation is not covered by League Rules.

**<u>L. Playoff Night</u>**

If the schedule has been organized with no flights, the top 4 teams will
make the playoff night. If the schedule has been organized with 2
flights, the top 2 teams from <u>each</u> flight make the playoff night.
In the case of a tie, the first tie breaker for any format would be
head-to-head points during the regular season. The second tie breaker
for a no flight format would be total points scored against the other
playoff eligible teams. If there are two flights, the second tie breaker
would be total points scored against other teams within the flight.

Playoff Team Schedule: Selection of the nines to be played for each set
of playoff matches will be based on a random draw overseen by the
President and Secretary.

Non-Playoff Team Schedule: The schedule (tee times and nines of play)
for non-playoff teams will be set based on the discretion of the
Secretary. Generally, earlier tee times are awarded to the non-playoff
teams with the higher number of points for the regular season.

Each golfer keeps score and points against 3 opponents using a scorecard
that will be provided by the league Secretary, and the same scoring
rules as regular season. At the conclusion of the round each golfer will
review their opponents’ score cards and sign them, indicating their
agreement with scores and points.

Every golfer playing in the playoff must have an established handicap.

A sub for a playoff team can be any regular member or regular team
member sub from a non-playoff team. Additionally, a sub for a playoff
team can be any general sub from the sub list as long as the general sub
has an established handicap. A playoff sub’s handicap can be lower,
equal to, or higher than the handicap of the golfer he or she is subbing
for.

No “gimmees”. All putts must be holed out.

Team captains will be responsible for collecting their team’s score
cards, verifying their team members’ final scores and points and will
also be responsible for turning in one scorecard to the Secretary, along
with their team’s individual score sheets. In the event that the
Secretary chooses to use a laptop with spreadsheet to calculate to
determine playoff results, the team captains will also assist the
Secretary with data entry for their team.

In the event of a tie for first place in the playoff, the following
tiebreakers will be used. First: regular season head-to-head points.
Second: playoff seeding.

In the event of a rainout on the playoff night, the team with the most
points in the regular season will be declared the winner of the playoff.

**<u>M. Prize Money and Awards:</u>**

Will be awarded at the discretion of the officers using remaining funds
available from the dues.
