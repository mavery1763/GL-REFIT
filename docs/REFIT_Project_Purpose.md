# REFIT Project Purpose

The **Golf League REFIT Project** modernizes and stabilizes the scoring and reporting system used by the Timken Metallus Monday Night Golf League. The legacy Excel workbook—accumulated over many years—contains deeply interwoven formulas, fragile transformations, and multiple hidden dependencies that make weekly scoring slow, error-prone, and difficult for new secretaries to maintain.

REFIT replaces that environment with a **structured, settings-driven, Power Query–based architecture** designed for durability, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

## Core Purpose

- **Automate scoring workflows**, eliminating manual transformations.
- **Standardize data inputs and outputs** using formal schemas.
- **Encapsulate business rules** in clear, documented M-code modules.
- **Structure the data pipeline** into well-defined stages (Raw → Staging → Analytics).
- **Enable future flexibility**, allowing the league to evolve without rewriting the system.
- **Produce analytics-quality datasets**, enabling long-term statistics and improvement tracking.
- **Provide a maintainable system** for future secretaries with minimal technical burden.

## Key Outcomes

- Weekly match reports can be ingested automatically.
- Scoring logic is centralized and version-controlled.
- League parameters and rules are controlled entirely through a **Settings** sheet.
- The entire system is transparent, documented, and reproducible.
- Developers and maintainers can quickly understand system components.
- The league gains a stable foundation for future enhancements.

REFIT is not only a rewrite of a workbook — it is the creation of a **full scoring system**, designed for longevity and clarity.
